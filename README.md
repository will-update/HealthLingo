A website used for keeping yourself in good mental health using tasks, learning about good health practices through a Duolingo style questions. The app has built in leaderboards, streaks and other things.

Built with HTML, CSS and Javascript with a Flask Python backend.



## Inspiration
As students, mental health is really important to us, and keep track of our habits is difficult. On top of that we felt that we didn't know that much about mental health and what specific practices lead to better mental health besides the general stuff.

## What it does
HealthLingo has a couple parts to it, first it have a habit tracker where you can keep track of your good habits that promote mental health, such as mediating for a few minutes each day or going to sleep at a reasonable time (which I did not due ;-;). On top of that we have a lessons on the website where you can learn some more specifics about health, on various topics. These lessons would teach you more than just what to do but why you do it and the most effective ways to. Hopefully helping our users create better habits, feel better, and become the person they want to be.

## How we built it
We initial looks for inspirations, and then prototyped our design in Figma, before building the design with HTML, CSS and JavaScript hosted on a Python (Flask) backend. 

## Challenges we ran into
We were working as a 2 person team, with not that much technically knowledge between us so defining our limits and designing a website that we could feasibly build within the hackathon was hard, since there were a lot of features we though of but where either too complex or we didn't have enough time to finish in the end. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As a team of 2 first years (we just finished our first year of university), we were able to create 2 out of 3 parts of the website we wanted to build, and while it's not finished I'm proud of how far we've gotten in a short period of time.

## What we learned
I personally learned more about programming in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, calling internal APIs from JavaScript and how to properly handshake on REST requests, while also working under a time crunch. Will learned a lot about Figma, how to manipulate shapes, create designs and a bit about design theory (what colors go together and where to place things within the website).

## What's next for HealthLingo
A lot of functionality could be added, but next up will be the leaderboards section (streaks, daily, weekly and monthly leaderboards where you can compete against other people for goal completed or lessons done), more goals, lessons, and hopefully a functional database.
